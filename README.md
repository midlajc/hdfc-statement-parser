## How To Use

1. Open the app and select a tool from the home screen.
2. Upload your file(s) using drag-and-drop or file picker.
3. If prompted, enter the PDF password.
4. Wait for parsing to complete.
5. Download the generated CSV or preview it in the app.

## PWA Features

- Installable on mobile and desktop
- Share PDF to app on supported mobile browsers
- macOS desktop file open support
- Offline app shell support after first load

## Privacy

All processing happens locally in your browser. Files are never uploaded to any server.

## Adding a New Parser

1. Create `parsers/your-parser.js` exporting: `id`, `name`, `description`, `icon`, `accept`, `fileLabel`, `needsPassword`, `parseFile`, `getColumns`, `isValidFile`.
2. Import and add it to the `tools` array in `app.js`.
3. Add the file path to `APP_SHELL` in `service-worker.js`.

## Notes

- Parsing is heuristic and depends on statement layout.
- Transactions are sorted by date in the output.
- If you update/reinstall the PWA, relaunch the app before testing share/open flows.
